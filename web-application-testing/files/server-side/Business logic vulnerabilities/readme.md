# Business Logic Vulnerabilities

## What Are Business Logic Vulnerabilities?

**Business logic vulnerabilities** are flaws in how an application is designed or implemented that allow attackers to exploit intended features in unintended ways. These flaws often occur because developers fail to anticipate abnormal or malicious user behavior.

> Also known as: *application logic vulnerabilities* or *logic flaws*.

These vulnerabilities are often hard to detect and typically cannot be found by automated scanners because they depend on context-specific rules and workflows.

---

## How Do They Arise?

- **Flawed assumptions** about how users will behave or interact with the application.
- **Overreliance on client-side controls**, such as form validations, which are easily bypassed.
- **Complex systems** where developers lack a complete understanding of how components interact.
- **Poor documentation** of workflows and assumptions.

---

## Potential Impact

Business logic flaws can range from **minor bugs** to **critical security issues**, including:

- Bypassing authentication or authorization
- Escalating user privileges
- Skipping payment steps
- Modifying transaction-critical values
- Causing financial loss or data exposure
- Damaging the business without direct attacker benefit

Even if a flaw doesn't seem exploitable, it should still be fixed — someone else may find a way to abuse it.

## Examples

- Skipping a payment step in an e-commerce checkout process
- Applying multiple discount codes when only one should be allowed
- Cancelling an order after receiving the product and getting a refund
- Modifying price or quantity of an item via parameter tampering

## Prevention Best Practices

To prevent business logic vulnerabilities:

- **Understand the business domain** — developers and testers must know the rules the app enforces.
- **Avoid implicit assumptions** — validate everything on the server side.
- **Verify application state** before taking critical actions.
- **Document logic clearly** — maintain workflows and note assumptions.
- **Write readable code** — clarity helps identify flaws early.
- **Think about side effects** — understand how components depend on each other.

> Tip: Analyze any logic flaw that occurs — it often signals deeper process or documentation weaknesses.

## Summary

Business logic vulnerabilities are a serious risk, especially because they are subtle and hard to detect. By improving design practices, validation routines, and team collaboration, these flaws can be minimized and caught early in the development lifecycle.
